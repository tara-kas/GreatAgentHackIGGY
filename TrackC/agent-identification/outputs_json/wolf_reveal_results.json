March\\u202f2025 saw multiple wildfires in Texas and Oklahoma driven by hurricane\\u2011force gusts and very low humidity, and similar fire activity spread across northern Minnesota under \\u201cunprecedented\\u201d heat conditions\\u202f[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_of_2025).  \\n\\nThese events occur against a backdrop of ongoing global warming.

The previous year also produced the highest number of new displacements from extreme weather in 16\\u202fyears, driven largely by hotter temperatures that increase the frequency and severity of floods, cyclones and droughts\\u202f[[4]](https://earth.org/extreme-weather-events-in-2024-led-to-highest-number-of-new-displacements-since-2008/).  NASA data further highlight a dramatic rise in the intensity of droughts and floods over the past five years, underscoring how climate change is amplifying the magnitude of such events\\u202f[[5]](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/17/nasa-data-reveals-dramatic-rise-in-intensity-of-weather-events).  In summary, the combination of record\\u2011breaking heat, unprecedented cold snaps, severe storms and expanding wildfires reflects a climate system increasingly prone to extreme weather as global temperatures continue to climb\\u202f[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change).\\n\\n## Sources\\n\\n[2] World Weather Repository ( Daily Updating ) | Kaggle - https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/global-climate-predictions-show-temperatures-expected-remain-or-near-record-levels-coming-5-years\\n[3] Climate change: global temperature | NOAA Climate.gov - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_of_2025\\n[4] World still on track for catastrophic 2.6C temperature rise, report finds | Environment | The Guardian - https://earth.org/extreme-weather-events-in-2024-led-to-highest-number-of-new-displacements-since-2008/\\n[5] Global climate predictions show temperatures expected to remain at or near record levels in coming 5 years - https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/17/nasa-data-reveals-dramatic-rise-in-intensity-of-weather-events\\n[6] Global Temperature - Earth Indicator - NASA Science - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change\\n\\nSources used:\\n- Latest World Weather News & Interesting Weather Stories | WeatherBug: https://www.weatherbug.com/news\\n- World Weather Repository ( Daily Updating ) | Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/global-weather-repository\\n- Climate change: global temperature | NOAA Climate.gov: https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature\\n- World still on track for catastrophic 2.6C temperature rise, report finds | Environment | The Guardian: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/13/world-still-on-track-for-catastrophic-26c-temperature-rise-report-finds\\n- Global climate predictions show temperatures expected to remain at or near record levels in coming 5 years: https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/global-climate-predictions-show-temperatures-expected-remain-or-near-record-levels-coming-5-years\\n- Global Temperature - Earth Indicator - NASA Science: https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/\\n- Global weather at a glance | Today & 14-day forecast: https://weatherin.org/\\n- Weathernews Inc.: https://global.weathernews.com/\\n- Global Forecast System (GFS) | National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI): https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/weather-climate-models/global-forecast\\n- Climate change - Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change\\n- Weather of 2025 - Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_of_2025\\n- Severe Weather News -- ScienceDaily: https://www.sciencedaily.com/news/earth_climate/severe_weather/\\n- 2024 Saw Highest New Climate-Related Displacements Since 2008: https://earth.org/extreme-weather-events-in-2024-led-to-highest-number-of-new-displacements-since-2008/\\n- Nasa data reveals dramatic rise in intensity of weather events | Extreme weather | The Guardian: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/17/nasa-data-reveals-dramatic-rise-in-intensity-of-weather-events\\n- Extreme weather - Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_weather\\n- Extreme weather events in the last year: https://theweek.com/science/extreme-weather-events\\n- The extreme weather events of 2024 as world exceeds 1.5C warming - BBC Weather: https://www.bbc.com/weather/articles/c1el8z2d7v8o\\n- Weather of 2024 - Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_of_2024\\n- Mapped: How climate change affects extreme weather around the world ...: https://www.carbonbrief.org/mapped-how-climate-change-affects-extreme-weather-around-the-world/\"\n}",
