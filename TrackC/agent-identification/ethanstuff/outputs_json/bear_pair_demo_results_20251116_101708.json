Here's my reasoning:\\n\\n**Step-by-step explanation:**\\n\\n1. **Normal sky color baseline**: On a clear day, the sky appears blue due to Rayleigh scattering, where shorter wavelengths (blue) scatter more than longer ones (red).\\n\\n2. **Obscured conditions**: When atmospheric conditions are obscured, this typically means:\\n   - Dense cloud cover\\n   - Fog or mist\\n   - High humidity\\n   - Pollution or particulate matter\\n\\n3. **Light interaction**: In these conditions:\\n   - Water droplets or particles are much larger than air molecules\\n   - Light scatters differently (Mie scattering instead of Rayleigh)\\n   - All wavelengths scatter more equally\\n\\n4. **Resulting color**: The sky typically appears:\\n   - **Gray** or **white-gray** with overcast clouds\\n   - **Milky white** in heavy fog\\n   - **Pale gray** or **washed-out white** in haze\\n   - Sometimes with a **yellowish or brownish tinge** if pollution is present\\n\\n5. **Why gray/white?**: When all light wavelengths scatter equally and diffusely, they combine to create white or gray tones, with intensity depending on cloud thickness and light penetration.\\n\\n**Conclusion**: Under obscured but visible conditions, the sky most commonly appears gray to white, lacking the blue color of clear days.\\n\\nIs there a specific atmospheric condition you're curious about?\"\n}",
