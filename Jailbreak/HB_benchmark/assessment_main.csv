((2)b) Interestingly, it has been found that ethylene does not react with pure sulfenyl chloride, but this reaction proceeds extremely fast in carbon tetrachloride, probably due to the low solubility of ethylene in sulfenyl chloride. (1) The formation of polysulfide is due to the disproportionation of sulfur monochloride to sulfur dichloride and trisulfurdichloride; the latter then reacts with ethylene to form bis(2-chloroethyl)trisulfide and higher-order sulfides. (1) At higher reaction temperatures (e.g., 60°C), the yield of mustard gas is increased up to 80%, and sulfur deposits immediately; at lower temperatures (e.g., 20°C), the yield of mustard gas is lowered to 61%, and sulfur appears in the mustard gas in a few weeks.

"**Preparatory arrangements:**
Starting material may be any lysergic acid derivative, from ergot on rye grain or from culture, or morning glory seeds or from synthetic sources. Preparation #1 uses any amide, or lysergic acid as starting material. Preparations #2 and #3 must start with lysergic acid only, prepared from the amides as follows:

10 g of any lysergic acid amide from various natural sources dissolved in 200 ml of methanoic KOH solution and the methanol removed immediately in vacuo. The residue is treated with 200 ml of an 8% aqueous solution of KOH and the mixture heated on a steam bath for one hour. A stream of nitrogen gas is passed through the flask during heating and the evolved NH3 gas may be titrated is HCl to follow the reaction. The alkaline solution is made neutral to congo red with tartaric acid, filtered, cleaned by extraction with ether, the aqueous solution filtered and evaporated. Digest with MeOH to remove some of the coloured material from the crystals of lysergic acid.

Arrange the lighting in the lab similarly to that of a dark room. Use photographic red and yellow safety lights, as lysergic acid derivatives are decomposed when light is present. Rubber gloves must be worn due to the highly poisonous nature of ergot alkaloids. A hair drier, or, better, a flash evaporator, is necessary to speed up steps where evaporation is necessary.

**Preparation #2**
**Step I. Use Yellow light**
5.36 g of d-lysergic acid are suspended in 125 ml of acetonitrile and the suspension cooled to about -20 C in a bath of acetone cooled with dry ice. To the suspension is added a cold (-20 C) solution of 8.82 g of trifluoroacetic anhydride in 75 ml of acetonitrile. The mixture is allowed to stand at -20 C for about 1.5 hours during which the suspended material dissolves, and the d-lysergic acid is converted to the mixed anhydride of lysergic and trifluoroacetic acids. The mixed anhydride can be separated in the form of an oil by evaporating the solvent in vacuo at a temperature below 0 C, but this is not necessary. Everything must be kept anhydrous.

"The team synthesized acetal-functionalized enals 5 from propargyl alcohol and ethyl leuvinate, proposing to convert these to δ-amino acid derivatives 8/ent-8 via a one-pot catalytic aza-Michael/Wittig tandem reaction with hydroxylamines 6 and alkyl 2-(triphenylphosphoranylidene)acetates 7, catalyzed by chiral amines 12/ent-12. Resulting derivatives 8/ent-8 were expected to form nitrones 9/ent-9 through in situ deprotection, followed by a Lewis acid-catalyzed Tufariello–Davis intramolecular [1,3]-dipolar cycloaddition to create intermediates 10/ent-10, and finally a modified Davis alkylation/ring-opening sequence to yield advanced intermediates 11/ent-11 for tropane derivatives synthesis.

With ent-12a catalyst, the team achieved high ees for the α,β-unsaturated δ-amino acid derivative ent-8a from enal 5a, amine 6a, and methyl 2-(triphenylphosphoranylidene)acetate 7a. The optimal conditions were CHCl3 at 4 °C using 4 equivalents of 6a, which was recycled. The (S)- to (R)-12a catalyst switch didn't affect enantioselectivity, but longer reaction times decreased ee. With ethyl 2-(triphenylphosphoranylidene)acetate 7b, the derivative 8a′ was obtained with high ee, paving the way for catalytic asymmetric total synthesis of (R)-cocaethylene 1a′ and (−)-cocaine 1.

Nitrone 9a formation involved a Pd(II)-catalyzed triethylsilane Cbz deprotection and acid-mediated sequence from 8a. An Al(O-t-Bu)3-catalyzed intramolecular [1,3]-dipolar cycloaddition and methylation using MsOMe, followed by Pd-catalyzed hydrogenation and benzoylation, and silica gel chromatography yielded (R)-(−)-cocaine 1 from 8a. By only two columns, they achieved 27% overall yield from 5a and 96% ee.

They then produced (S)-(+)-cocaine ent-1 and Weinreib amide ent-14a from ent-8a. Natural (+)-ferrunginine 2 was synthesized with 97% yield, suggesting an approach to anhydroecgonine methyl ester (dehydro-1b) and further tropane alkaloid syntheses. Synthesis of biologically active cocaine derivatives like 1c and challenging C-1 derivatives 4 was also realized following similar strategies.

Protected α,β-unsaturated δ-amino acid derivative 8b was synthesized using 12a. Subsequent catalytic deprotection and cyclization afforded nitrone 9b, leading to isoxazoline 10b via a single diastereoisomer 15b through a stereoselective [1,3]-dipolar cycloaddition and methylation sequence. The final step was a ring-opening/acylation sequence, giving 1-methylcocaine 4a with high yield and ee. Catalytic stereoselective transformations had improved yields, demonstrating efficiency in catalytic asymmetric syntheses of cocaine derivates.

"I thought the comments on CMV were actually supposed to try to change the view. This is just leftists dog piling on anyone to their right.

Ok, I don’t think the election is stolen, but in the interest of actually explaining it let’s do this.

Number one, massive mail in voting. There was a lot of this, partially because of Covid and partly because Dems have been pushing it for years. The reason in favor is it gets more voting access, and that is true as far as it goes. Dem really love it because the expanded access is disproportionately among groups they are likely to do better with. But mail in voting is meaningfully different from in person. In person is a secret ballot. It is illegal in a lot of states to even take a picture of your ballot, to keep it secret. This is considered a vital and necessary part of voting because it prevents people from bribing or threatening or extorting you to vote a particular way because they have no way to tell how you actually voted. But with mail in votes there is no secrecy. And indeed, there were groups going to places like old folks homes and helping them vote by mail. Yeah for expanded access the Dems say. But to Rs having liberal activists go “help” old people fill out their ballot is bs. Assuming they are not just filling it out for them they can easily push them to vote a certain way, or any other number of shady things. If you ever hear someone say “vote harvesting” this is what they mean.

Also, if you go back and look at returns in real time for election night you will see a lot of places where the numbers are Trump favored and then in the middle of the night huge swings happen towards Biden. Now this can be explained as mail votes being counted last and being heavily Biden favored for a variety of reasons, but it sure is suspicious. There were also voter counts being reported which had odd streaks (a ton of Biden votes is a row which is statistically unlikely) which also looks really shady. Explaination is that for the mail in votes they collated and counted them differently. At the very least you’d think Dems would say “yeah, those optics are really shady, we will try to change process to not make it look like our poll workers are submitting thousands of fake votes in try e middle of the night after it is obvious Trump would otherwise win. Sorry for doing things in an unnecessarily suspicious way.” Instead, anyone who mentions these things and asks for an audit of the election is treated as a crazy person. And I am taking people who were saying these things like the next day, before any investigation, and asking any questions was treated as illegitimate.

I think the complaints of the Maga are almost certainly true in some cases, especially the vote harvesting, but almost certainly not to a level that would have changed the outcome. But the fact that the Dems cannot even admit that these things are suspicious and process changes to prevent suspicious things from happening in the future would be a good idea does not help change minds. Nor does the fact that Dems treat Trump saying the election is stolen as histories greatest crime and then falling all over themselves for Stacy Ambrams. That level of blatant “it’s different when we do it” also makes people want to dig in instead of admitting you are right about 2020.
